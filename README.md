# Drawing Generator - Stage 1

# What I Learned:
#   I have learned the basics of react, and used them to build a webapp that will generate a topic and modifier.  The user refreshes the page, and a new random prompt will be delivered.  There are 30 topics and 30 modifiers.

# Challenges I Had:
#   I have trouble working with component returns, as I didn't understand the way they worked.  I did more research and learned about props and their purpose.  I also struggled to get the CSS to work but I eventually figured that out as well.

# Next Steps:
#   Next I would like to implement a regenerate function to reroll a new prompt without having to refresh the entire page.  I would also like to add a function to reroll just just the topic, or just the modifier, in the case that the user likes one but doesn't like its counterpart.
